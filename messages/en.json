    "p": "My first contact with programming was in 2009, using SQL Server 2000 and MySQL technologies, creating, restoring, and managing databases, as well as building websites with PHP. Always striving to improve my knowledge on a daily basis, I’m not afraid of the unknown and aim to evolve every day. New challenges are always welcome—I love learning new technologies and solving problems. Passionate about coffee, my vinyl records, and Rock ’n’ Roll, and a guitar enthusiast.🤘🏻🎸",
