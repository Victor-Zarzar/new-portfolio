# TLS Certificates with SAN (Subject Alternative Name) and Their Use in Multi-Domain Applications

When requesting or issuing a TLS/SSL certificate today, there is a mandatory and fundamental field called **Subject Alternative Name (SAN)**.

In practice, SAN defines which hostnames, domains, or IP addresses that certificate is authorized to protect. Since modern browsers stopped relying exclusively on the Common Name (CN), SAN became the **only valid mechanism** for domain validation in TLS certificates.

This is precisely the field that enables so-called **multi-domain certificates**, allowing a single certificate to protect multiple domains and subdomains — even completely different domains.

---

## What Can Be Included in a SAN?

A SAN certificate can include, for example:

- Full domains (`example.com`, `www.example.com`)
- Subdomains (`api.example.com`, `admin.example.com`)
- Different domains in the same certificate (`example.com`, `example.net`)
- Wildcards (`*.example.com`)
- IP addresses (less common, but possible in internal environments)

This makes SAN extremely useful in modern architectures, especially in environments with:

- Reverse proxies
- Containers
- Cloud
- Multi-tenant systems
- Microservices

---

## Main Use Cases for Subject Alternative Name (SAN)

### 1. Protecting Multiple Root Domains with One Certificate

A common mistake is assuming that a wildcard certificate solves all scenarios. In reality:

- `*.example.com` only protects first-level subdomains
- It does **not** cover:
  - `example.com` (root domain)
  - Other domains like `example.net`

With a SAN certificate, you can combine everything into a single artifact:

- `example.com`
- `www.example.com`
- `api.example.com`
- `example.net`
- `www.example.net`

This is extremely useful for:

- White-label applications
- Multi-tenant environments
- Systems serving multiple clients with their own domains

---

### 2. Hosting Multiple HTTPS Sites on the Same IP (Virtual Hosts)

Before SNI (Server Name Indication), each HTTPS site required a dedicated IP. Today, with SNI + SAN certificates:

- You can host multiple HTTPS sites on the same IP
- A single server can securely serve multiple domains

Servers like Apache, Nginx, and IIS handle SAN certificates very well, especially when combined with SNI.

This scenario is common in:

- Shared hosting
- Cloud environments with limited IPs
- Ingress controllers and load balancers

---

### 3. Real Simplification of TLS/SSL Management

Fewer certificates mean:

- Fewer renewals (manual or automated)
- Less risk of unexpected expiration
- Fewer duplicated configurations
- Fewer operational errors

Instead of:

- Multiple IPs
- Multiple certificates
- Multiple TLS chains

You centralize everything in a single SAN certificate, keeping configuration cleaner, more predictable, and easier to automate (especially with ACME / Let’s Encrypt).

---

## Important Notes (Critical Points)

- **SAN limit:** Certificate authorities impose limits (e.g., 100 SANs per certificate).
- **Renewal affects all domains:** If one domain fails validation, the entire issuance can fail.
- **Revocation is global:** If the certificate is compromised, all protected domains are affected.
- **Not always the best choice:** In very large environments, it may be safer to separate certificates by context or application.

---

## When Does a SAN Certificate Make Sense?

Use SAN when you have:

- Shared infrastructure
- Multiple domains under the same control
- Reverse proxies or API gateways
- SaaS or multi-tenant applications
- Strong certificate automation

Avoid SAN when:

- Domains belong to different owners
- You need strong isolation per application
- There is high operational risk in renewal failures

---

## Conclusion

SAN (Subject Alternative Name) is not just a technical detail — it is a central element of modern TLS architecture. It allows you to reduce complexity, operational costs, and points of failure, while perfectly fitting cloud, containerized, and distributed application scenarios.
