# Mobile Device Protection

In 2023, a smartphone or tablet has become indispensable in our lives, present in our daily routine. However, with so many functions and data that these devices carry, we must be concerned about the security of our data. Here are some essential tips:

## 1. Password Management

Create passwords with special characters, numbers, and letters. There are applications like Keepass Touch, Keepassium, KeepassDroid, among others, that can help manage and protect your passwords. Maintaining a secure password file is essential nowadays.

## 2. Biometric Authentication

Use facial recognition/biometrics on your device to ensure greater security, especially when using banking apps and other applications with sensitive data. These protections have been available on mobile devices since Android 4.0 and iOS 7, and Apple's Face ID was introduced in iOS 11 in 2017.

## 3. Photo Geolocation

Disable your phone's location when taking photos unless you intend to publish them on social media. Disabling geolocation prevents geographic information from being stored with photos. Currently, social media applications remove geolocation by default when publishing a photo.

## 4. Bluetooth

Disable Bluetooth and use it only when necessary, as it can be a gateway for cybercriminal attacks.

## 5. Public Wi-Fi Networks

When using public Wi-Fi networks, use a VPN (virtual private network) to protect your data from being publicly exposed. The VPN encrypts all traffic, ensuring your security.

## 6. App Permissions

Be careful with the permissions granted to applications. Some permissions may be unnecessary and can be used to collect user data. Carefully review permissions before authorizing an application.

## 7. Software Updates

Always keep your device updated with the latest available software version. Devices with outdated versions may have vulnerabilities that cybercriminals can exploit to collect data.

## 8. Cloud Backups

Make constant cloud backups to ensure the protection and secure storage of your information in case of theft or loss of the device.

## 9. Safe Disposal

When replacing your old device with a new one, make sure to perform a complete reset, erasing all your data from the old device.

## 10. App Downloads

Be careful when downloading applications. Download apps only from trusted sources, such as the App Store or Play Store, and always check reviews and ratings from other users to identify possible problems and vulnerabilities.

## 11. Two-Factor Authentication

Enable two-factor authentication whenever possible in your applications. This adds an extra layer of security to protect your data.

## 12. Auto-Lock

Enabling automatic screen lock is a good practice to prevent unauthorized use of the device, especially in cases of loss or theft.

## 13. Physical Care

Treat your mobile device with the same care you treat your wallet. Don't leave it in unsupervised locations and hand it over only to trusted people. This practice is fundamental to ensuring the security of your data.
